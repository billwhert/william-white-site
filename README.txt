# Fix Blank Screen Patch

Drop these files into your project (overwrite if prompted):

- src/components/Cards.tsx
- src/pages/Experience.tsx

Then run:
```
npm run dev
```

If you still see a blank page, check the terminal for module-not-found errors and confirm these files exist with the exact paths above.
